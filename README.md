# Employee-Tracker
SQL Challenge

## Description

    As a user, I need an application/database that will assist my company in keeping track of its employees, departments, and roles.  In doing so, the application should be functional and the user should be able to view all the departments, add a department, view all roles, and view all the employees currently working for the company.

## Installation

## Usage

When you open the employee tracker, a list of options appear.  When the user clicks `view all departments` , you can see a list of all the departments and the corresponding department_id.  When you click `add department`, the user will be prompted to enter the name of the department that is being added, and once it's entered, a message appears stating `'<new-department> added as a department!'`. When the user scrolls down to and selects `view all roles`, a list appears, and you can see the role_id, job title, current salary, and the department_id.  When the user scrolls and selects `view all employees`, a list of all the current employees appears, and you can see the employees id, first name, last name, role_id, and manager_id.
